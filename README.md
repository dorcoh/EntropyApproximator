A supplement for the book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/perturbations-optimization-and-statistics">"Perturbations, Optimization, and Statistics"</a> (edited by Tamir Hazan, George Papandreou and Daniel Tarlow) - Chapter 9: "Probabilistic Inference by Hashing and Optimization" by Stefano Ermon

<b>Notice:</b> The tools described here are under copyright of Stefano Ermon , his README's are inside the directories

Here we describe a comparison between <b>approximate</b> inference/counting tools (using hashing and optimization oracle), and <b>precise</b> ones:

# STS - Search Tree Sampler vs. Cachet
## (Approximate model counter) vs. (Precise model counter)

Formula1 ( input size x )
TimeApprox, TimePrecise, Difference
OutputApprox, OutputPrecise, Difference, Perecentage

Formula2 ( input size 5x )

Formula3 ( input size 10x )

Difference

# WISH vs. ?
## (Approximate inference) vs (Precise inference)

Formula1 ( input size x )

Formula2 ( input size 5x )

Formula3 ( input size 10x )

Difference

# Conclusions

We worked hard, and achieved very little.
